#### To Submit the test.
Submit a link to your new repo which is preferably public.

If the repo is private then you will be given instructions on who to invite to be able to clone the repo.

Do the test and please commit frequently as we want to see your thought processes in solving the test.

This should take about an hour. 
If there are things you think should be done but you dont have time then make comments in your code. 

Good comments are as valid as code.

### Post Test.

####Assumption
I have noticed that in the html template when degree is Third (DegreeGradeEnum.third), one of the line breaker is written as <br> where as in all other places it is <br/>. I believe this a typo and corrected this as this string in now coming from a single place to avoid code duplication.     

####TODO/COMMENTS
1.	Add more unit test cases for handlers. 
2.	Exception handling and error logging can be improved by doing error and exception handling at low level.
3.	Getting HTML template for each case can be done using a service that inherit from a common interface. By doing this, the output string can be changed dynamically. 
4.	Can add more validation/deficiency coding
